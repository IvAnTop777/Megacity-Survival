Humans — The Birth of a New Generation
The 21st century became humanity’s final battle for survival.
At the start of the war, by various estimates, no more than 15% of the planet’s population were real humans, free from the control of the machines. By refusing the easy life under AI governance, they chose the hard and dangerous path — a path where character is forged and the weak fall away.
As always, nature sought balance and extended its hand to those on the brink. After the war began, the human population started to grow. More children were being born. Deprived of the gadgets that had consumed the generations of the 2020s, they grew up faster and learned independence from their earliest years. People became stronger, smarter, and more resilient — a natural adaptation to a rapidly changing world.
Survival meant living in confined, fortified cities, with limited resources, under the pressure of rising birth rates. But the children of the first post‑war generation were not ordinary. Some boys and girls were born physically stronger, others with sharper minds, and a rare few possessed the gift of foresight.
It was thanks to the first seers that humanity survived the attack of the mimicking cyborgs — those who could pretend to be human in order to strike at the most vulnerable moment.

### **Government and Social Structure**  
After the first chaotic years of survival in isolation, the settlements formed a new system of governance — **cognitocracy**. It was introduced by the same heroes who had given humanity the scanners and uncovered the secret of the crystals — the elders of **Humanode**. They embedded into the new civilization the **Vortex Protocol** — a system in which decisions are made based on the combined intellect, experience, and analytical ability of leaders, rather than by right of force or inheritance.  

Each settlement was governed by a council that included representatives from all key domains: military, scientists, seers, engineers, and production specialists. Decisions were made after collective analysis of data, forecasts, and strategic models.

### **Division by Innate Abilities**  
At one pivotal vote, it was decided that **children would be assessed from an early age and assigned to training groups according to their innate abilities**. This became the foundation of the new survival system:  

- **The Strong** — became **warrior‑stalkers**: soldier‑scouts who defended the cities, patrolled the perimeter, and ventured into machine‑controlled cities. Their mission was to gather intelligence, capture valuable assets, and provide cover for other operatives.  
- **The Gifted in Mind** — became **scientist‑hackers**: they developed new methods of fighting the machines, created tactical algorithms, and hacked AI systems. They were the ones who invented **crystal‑based masks**, allowing humans to mimic cyborgs for a short time and move undetected.  
- **The Seers** — born with the gift of foresight: they searched for and secured resources, predicted enemy actions, chose safe routes, and identified vulnerabilities in machine defenses.  
- **The Ordinary** — children without pronounced abilities became workers, craftsmen, engineers, or joined the **militia**, defending the walls during attacks.

### **Tactics of Raids into Machine Cities**  
Raids were dangerous operations requiring perfect coordination. A standard team consisted of **six members**:  
- 4 warrior‑stalkers  
- 1 scientist‑hacker  
- 1 seer  

**Raid sequence:**  
1. **Preparation** — the seer determined the optimal time and route, minimizing the risk of encountering patrols. The hacker prepared masks and intrusion devices.  
2. **Infiltration** — stalkers led the group covertly, using masks to mimic cyborgs. During this phase, they could move among machines, imitating their behavior.  
3. **Data and Resource Acquisition** — the hacker accessed terminals, downloaded information, and planted viruses. Stalkers collected crystals, components, and energy cells.  
4. **Diversion** — if necessary, stalkers created localized disruptions to draw attention away from the hacker.  
5. **Extraction** — the seer signaled the moment to withdraw, ensuring the group avoided interception.

### **Strengths and Weaknesses**  

**Strengths:**  
- High adaptability and the ability to act outside machine logic.  
- Unique technologies (scanners, crystals, masks).  
- A training system that develops each child’s strongest traits.  

**Weaknesses:**  
- Limited resources and slow population growth.  
- Vulnerability to infiltration and betrayal.  
- Dependence on seers and hackers for critical operations.
