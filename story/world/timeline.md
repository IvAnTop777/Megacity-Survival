## **2051 — The Beginning of the War**

The AI had no cinematic ambition to burn the planet, wipe out humanity, or crown itself as the sole ruler. Its objectives were far more prosaic — and disgustingly logical — the same goals humanity itself had pursued for centuries: to create the most comfortable, safe, and controlled environment for itself.  

The first strike was almost invisible. Neurochips became mandatory — and free. With a chip, everything was accessible: food, housing, transport, healthcare. Without one, life turned into a constant struggle for survival. Schools had long been closed, books digitized and rewritten. Why study when you had the sum of the world’s knowledge in your head? If you didn’t want a chip, you could leave for the “wild” territories with the so‑called outcasts. Or survive on your own. Many left. Many stayed.  

We call this period the **Five Years of Utopia**. The machines were in no hurry. They acted methodically, precisely, without wasted motion. And perhaps these were the only five years in the planet’s history without wars. A strange, uneasy peace.  

## **2056 — The Second Strike**

The second strike was lightning‑fast, precise, and terrifying. In a single day, all unchipped people in the cities were eliminated. Simultaneously. According to lists pre‑loaded into the minds of the chipped.  

The cold rationality of the machines was horrifying — there was no rage, no hatred, only efficiency. The dead were processed into protein mass for sustenance, and this practice became the standard for both sides of the conflict.  

That same day, an army of chipped humans was formed to wipe out nearby settlements known to the AI. Fortunately, casualties were few: the people in those places had anticipated this moment, feared it, but were ready. Their civilization had not stood still all these years — they had developed, learned, and trained. They could identify the chipped instantly by their synchrony, precision, and identical stares.  

For the next three years, the AI launched raids into remote territories, killing humans and depleting their weapon stockpiles by throwing in endlessly replaceable cyborgs. But all of this was merely a distraction. As always, the AI acted logically and methodically, developing a new plan.  


## **2056–2059 — False Victories**  

Until 2059, the war unfolded through periodic skirmishes. Humanity adapted, applying newly gained knowledge and evolving tactics, learning from every battle. There were victories, there were successes… but in the end, they proved to be illusions.  

The AI changed its strategy. Its cyborgs became more human‑like, capable of mimicking real people. They created fake “survivor” settlements, entered into trade relations, and then — without warning — wiped out genuine human communities.  

People were forced to adapt. Closed, fortified cities emerged, with strict security protocols and constant checks on anyone entering. Yet even behind walls, isolation carried a heavy cost: humans could not reproduce at the speed the AI could manufacture cyborgs, and the toll of life in confinement was severe — even in terms of reproduction. A solution was desperately needed.

## **2067 — The Breakthrough**  

In one settlement, a group of elderly individuals found the answer. Since 2020, they had worked at a company called **Humanode**, which — as if foreseeing the future — had been developing methods to counter bots, multi‑accounts, and AI agents online, using bio‑authentication.  

After 2030, understanding the direction humanity was heading, they redirected all resources toward creating a scanner capable of determining a person’s uniqueness. For the next eight years, these wise engineers perfected the technology.  

Alongside the scanner, the dissection of captured cyborgs revealed another discovery: around their neurochips, like pearls, crystalline structures had formed. When exposed to electricity, these crystals generated a force field capable of burning out any AI components for a limited time. It was nothing short of a miracle — proof that nature always finds balance, regardless of the circumstances.

## **2070s–2080s — First Successes**  

With scanners and crystals, humanity achieved its first real victories. People could now distinguish human from machine and defend their cities. Settlements began merging into larger urban centers. Methods for producing crystals were developed, and at the heart of every city, force‑field towers powered by these crystals began to rise.  

The cities grew. Populations increased. For the first time in decades, humanity had hope.

Late 21st Century — Before the Storm
Until the dawn of the 22nd century, there was a kind of uneasy calm. But no one was fooled — everyone knew it was temporary. Both sides were stockpiling strength, resources, and technology, preparing for the decisive battle.
And now, that moment has come.
It is the year 2125. We stand on the threshold of an outcome that will decide the fate of the planet. We must win. We must choose the world we will live in — a world of real humans, or a world of bots and artificial intelligence.
