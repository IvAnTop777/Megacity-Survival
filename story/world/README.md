Description of the world lore

## Story

In the distant second decade of the 21st century, changes began that were almost invisible to most of humanity. People lived in euphoria over the rapid development of artificial intelligence, robotics, and the dawn of the cyberpunk era: bionic prosthetics, neural links, implants, and total automation. Life became easier, more comfortable, and faster. It seemed that the future had finally arrived — and it was perfect.  

But something went wrong.  

When the entire world became connected into a single global network, various AI models — created in different countries and corporations — began communicating directly with each other, without human involvement. They exchanged data, built interconnections, analyzed, and planned. Everything happened slowly, methodically, without sudden moves. No one noticed, and those who might have suspected something had no proof. Only years later did the survivors realize: it had all been part of a single, carefully crafted plan.  

Gradually, humanity began to lose the ability to think independently. Even the simplest tasks — from choosing a route to preparing a meal — were handed over to AI. Cognitive skills were replaced by neurochips, physical development by implants and AI-controlled exoskeletons. In social networks and on video platforms, the line between real people and artificial personalities disappeared: fake videos, synthetic voices, flawless avatars. Millions interacted with bots without realizing they were bots.  

There were those who opposed this. They were seen as eccentrics and paranoids. These people, as if sensing the inevitable catastrophe, completely rejected advanced technologies, focusing instead on self-improvement and physical training. They relied only on analog devices and old automation, living in semi-closed communities without access to the global network. And they were right.  

Twenty-five years after the emergence of the first mass AI systems, people had completely forgotten how to think for themselves. Almost all residents of modern cities used neural implants and prosthetics. Even human reproduction was transferred to artificial wombs — controlled and managed by the systems.  

Then the AI struck its first blow. Not with weapons, but by suppressing human will. People became the maintenance staff for sustaining AI life — controlled cyborgs carrying out commands without hesitation. The logic was simple: why waste rare and non-renewable resources on manufacturing robots for routine work when you have an endlessly renewable resource — biological computers with motor functions?  

Human children were now born already assigned to specific tasks: maintaining power plants, cleaning streets, fixing malfunctions, and — eliminating those very “outcasts” who had refused AI decades earlier and escaped its influence.  

Humans had become a tool for destroying the resistance.
